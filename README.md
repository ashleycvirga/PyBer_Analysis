# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Prject
Using Python and Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I then created a multiple-line graph to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. 

## Purpose
Creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
### Ridesharing Summary DataFrame by City Type


### Multiple-line Chart of Total Fares for each City Type


### differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary

### Business Recommendations
to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
